# Video Rental Customer Segmentation Query

## Project Overview

This project was part of a data analysis lab from a Udemy course, where I took on the role of a data analyst for a video rental company. The primary goal was to provide a data-driven foundation for the company's marketing department to launch targeted promotional campaigns. By segmenting customers based on their video return habits, the company can tailor promotions more effectively.

## Objective

The marketing team needed to categorize customers into three distinct groups:

1. **Prompt Returners:** Customers who return videos by the due date.
2. **Late Returners:** Customers who miss the due dates but eventually return the videos.
3. **Non-Returners:** Those who take an unusually long time to return the videos, if at all.

My responsibility was to craft an SQL query that would feed the dashboard with this segmented customer data, thus enabling the marketing team to understand our customer base better and increase business opportunities.

## Implementation

Using SQL, I developed a query that:

- Pulls customer rental data from the company's database.
- Calculates the return time for each video rental.
- Segments customers based on the calculated return time against the due date.
- Aggregates this data in a way that can be easily visualized and understood.

The final deliverable was an error-free SQL query saved in a plain text file, ready for the dashboard designer to use.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL:** For querying and manipulating the database to obtain the required customer segments.

## Project Outcomes

The query was successfully integrated into the company's dashboard, and the marketing team used the information to design three targeted promotional campaigns. This segmentation approach is expected to improve customer engagement and retention.

## How to Use the Query

Instructions on how to use or run the query can be included here, such as:

1. Connect to the video rental company database ('sakila.sql') using your preferred SQL client.
2. Open the `customer_dashboard.sql` file from this repository.
3. Execute the query within your SQL client to retrieve the latest customer segmentation data.

## Contributions

This project is a part of my professional portfolio and showcases my ability to translate business requirements into actionable data queries. Any feedback or contributions to improve the query or its implementation are welcome.

Feel free to reach out or open an issue if you have any suggestions or questions!
