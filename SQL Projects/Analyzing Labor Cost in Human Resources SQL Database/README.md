# Labor Cost Analysis at PaperPro

## Project Overview

In this project, undertaken as part of a Udemy Labs course, I worked as a key data analyst for PaperPro, a company focused on minimizing operational costs. The project revolved around analyzing and reducing labor expenses without significantly impacting the workforce.

## Objective

The primary aim was to perform an in-depth analysis of labor costs across various departments within the company. By leveraging the HR systems' employee database and the provided entity-relationship diagram, I developed SQL queries to:

- Calculate the total salaries paid by each department.
- Break down these costs by quarter during the current month.
- Ensure the analysis accounted for the start and end dates of employment to accurately reflect departmental labor costs.

## Implementation

To achieve the project's goals, I:

- Examined the entity-relationship diagram to understand the database schema.
- Crafted SQL queries to extract the necessary salary and department data.
- Utilized date functions to segment the salary data by quarter.
- Aggregated the data to provide a clear comparison of labor costs across departments.

The result was a set of SQL queries capable of delivering precise labor cost information, enabling the PaperPro management team to make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL:** For data extraction, manipulation, and aggregation from the HR employee database.

## Project Outcomes

The queries provided a clear view of the current labor cost structure, assisting the management in identifying key areas where cost reductions could be implemented effectively. This strategic analysis is expected to contribute significantly to the company's cost-saving initiatives.

## How to Use the Queries

To use the queries developed in this project:

1. Establish a connection to PaperPro's HR employee database using your SQL client.
2. Open the `labor_cost_analysis.sql` file from this repository.
3. Execute the queries to retrieve updated labor cost data segmented by department and quarter.

## Contributions

This project is showcased in my professional portfolio as an example of my analytical skills in the context of HR data analysis and operational cost reduction. I welcome any suggestions for improvements or questions regarding the methods used.
