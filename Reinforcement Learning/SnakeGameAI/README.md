# Python Game Development Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Python game development endeavor, structured around several key scripts that work together to create an engaging gaming experience. It involves the creation of game mechanics, AI agents, utility functions, and the core game model. Each script plays a crucial role:

- **agent.py**: Defines the AI agent's behavior, making decisions based on game states.
- **game.py**: Contains the main game loop, handling user inputs and rendering the game state.
- **helper.py**: Provides utility functions used across the project for various tasks like data manipulation and analysis.
- **model.py**: Represents the game's data model, including the state, players, and other entities.

## Features
- Modular Python scripts for easy understanding and maintenance.
- Implementation of AI algorithms for non-player characters.
- Efficient game state management and rendering.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- Pygame for rendering the game graphics and handling user input.
- NumPy for numerical operations, especially in `model.py` and `helper.py`.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install pygame numpy torch torchvision matplotlib ipython`.
4. Run `python agent.py` to watch the AI learn the game and get better.

## Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's adding new features, improving the AI algorithms, or fixing bugs, your input can help make this game better.
