# Grocery Store Sales Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive analysis and forecasting model for a national grocery store chain. The goal was to leverage historical sales data across various stores to forecast future sales, assisting the company in strategic planning and optimization of store performances. 

## Objectives

The main objectives of the project were to:

- Read and manipulate the sales data using Python with `pandas`.
- Visualize sales trends and patterns using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Develop a linear regression model using `scikit-learn` to forecast sales.
- Evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics, specifically focusing on RMSE.

## Approach

1. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, ensuring it was free of inconsistencies and ready for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted an initial investigation on the data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypothesis with the help of visualizations.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features that could potentially improve the model's predictive power.

4. **Model Building**: Implemented a linear regression model to predict future sales of new stores based on the store features provided in the dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's accuracy with RMSE, comparing the forecasted sales against the actual sales data to quantify the model's predictive performance.

6. **Reporting**: Compiled findings and insights into a Jupyter Notebook that serves as a comprehensive report for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Results

The developed linear regression model resulted in an RMSE of 3396, considering the mean sales value of 59351. This performance metric, along with the visualizations and analyses, provides valuable insights into the factors influencing store sales and aids in making informed business decisions for future store layouts and operations.
